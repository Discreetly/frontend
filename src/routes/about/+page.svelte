	<Introduction />
	<p class="text-justify my-3">
		This feels like a mostly familiar chat application, except there aren't user names. Under the
		hood, there is no "login", the server doesn't know who you are, you are anonymous. You're
		completely anonymous. <i class="italic">Unless you break the rules.</i>
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify my-3">
		The beauty of this system is that it fosters trust among group members, knowing that everyone in
		the chat is a verified member. At the same time, it provides the freedom to express oneself
		anonymously.
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify my-3">
		When you want to send a message in a room, you need to verify your membership in that room, but
		without giving away your identity. This is accomplished using a zero-knowledge proof, a clever
		piece of cryptography that lets you prove you know something, without having to reveal what that
		something is.
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify my-3">
		However, there's a small catch. To prevent spam, each time you send a message, you "share" a
		tiny piece of your identity that is only useful for that epoch (time period). If you send too
		many messages during an epoch, someone can reassemble your identity, all of your messages can be
		linked together, and you will be removed from the chat for spamming. This is done automatically
		and permanently, there is no unban.
