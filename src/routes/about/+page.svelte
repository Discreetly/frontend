	<h5 class="fst-italic mb-4">A new take on anonymous communication.</h5>
	<p>
		This feels like a mostly familiar chat application, with random numbers as usernames, but I
		assure you there is more going on here.
	</p>
	<p>
		Under the hood, there is no "login", the server doesn't know who you are, you are <span
			class="fst-italic">actually</span
		> anonymous.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is one catch, if you send messages too fast, someone can figure out which identity you
		are, and remove you from the chat. So if you try to break the rules, you will be removed, and
		there is no undo.
